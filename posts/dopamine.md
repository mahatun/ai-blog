Our brain is a funny thing.

Sometimes it does what we wanted it to do, such as checking emails or finding something to eat in the refrigerator. Other times it stuck and doesn't want to start on that important new project.

## Why are we obsessed with the things we want?

As a matter of fact, let's go a little bit deeper into this and ask:

- Why are we obsessed with the things we want, only to be bored when we get them?
- Why is addiction perfectly logical to an addict?
- Why does love change so quickly from passion to conflict?

The answer is found in a single chemical in your brain, it's called: **DOPAMINE**.

Dopamine assured the survival of early men. Thousands of years later, it is the source of our most basic behaviors, cultural ideas and progress itself.

Dopamine is the chemical of desire that always asks for MORE!

*More things!*

*More stimulation!*

*More surprises!*

Dopamine is the source of our every urge and every sense of motivation in our body. It is that little bit of biology that makes an ambitious business professional sacrifice everything in pursuit of his business success.
